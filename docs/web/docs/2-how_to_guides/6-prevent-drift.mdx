title: Preventing Drift
---

IAMbic provides a two-way sync between your Git repository and your cloud environment, ensuring that changes made in Git are reflected in the cloud,
and visa-versa.

However, there may be instances where you want to prevent out-of-band changes to resources that should only be managed through IAMbic.
This is where `iambic_managed: enforced` mode comes in.

By adding `iambic_managed: enforced` at the top-level of an IAMbic template, IAMbic will ensure that any out-of-band changes to the resource are
reverted to the state that is defined in Git. IAMbic ships with AWS Eventbridge rules that will automatically revert any out-of-band changes on enforced
templates to their Git state.

To manually perform this action, run `iambic apply --enforced-only --force` from within your iambic-templates repository.

## Example use cases:

1. IT administrators mistakenly added a user to the sensitive `cloud_admins` group in Okta. Typically, months could pass before
we detect this change. If we specify `iambic_managed: enforced` in this particular template,
IAMbic ensures that the state of the cloud represents what is in Git.

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::Okta::Group
iambic_managed: enforced
idp_name: development
properties:
  name: cloud_admins
  description: Cloud Administrators
  members:
    - username: user1@example.com
    - username: user2@example.com
```

2. DevOps maintains team roles across multiple AWS accounts, but a user with IAM permissions on one of the accounts makes changes to to these
roles in the cloud console. It's difficult to ensure that these permissions are always in sync with IaC, and it's likely that removing the
permissions would cause disruption or breakage.

Here is an example of a read_only role with `iambic_managed` mode set to `enforced`:

```yaml
template_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Role
iambic_managed: enforced
identifier: '{{var.account_name}}_readonly'
properties:
  description: Standard ReadOnly Role
  assume_role_policy_document:
    statement:
      - action:
          - sts:AssumeRole
          - sts:TagSession
        effect: Allow
        principal:
          aws: arn:aws:iam::12345:role/role1
    version: '2012-10-17'
  managed_policies:
    - policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess
  role_name: '{{var.account_name}}_readonly'
  tags:
    - key: owner
      value: cloud_admins@example.com
